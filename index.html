<p>Remember the time in school when you used markers to highlight any important parts of a text, just so that you could go through it quickly afterwards? With this app, you can simply go on reading a web page or a topic, and just keep on Ctrl+C the relevant parts of text which you want to save. Thus if you come across a really nice tutorial about some topic, you can save the most important paragraphs in a notes file, so that you can quickly recapitulate all that you read.</p>

<p>If you are on a Linux based distro, install xclip (sudo apt-get install xclip) and simply run the script file noteUtility.sh present in this repository. After this, any text that you copy will be pasted into a text file present in the path given in this script. By default it will be present in ~/myNotes folder. Once your note-taking is done, exit this script. All notes taken in a single invocation of this script will be put into a single text file. Every invocation will create a new notes file in the mentioned folder. </p>
